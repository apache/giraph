    <p>Releasing new version of Apache Giraph may take 2 weeks or more. Please, plan accordingly.</p>
    <p>Follow these steps to release new version of Apache Giraph.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check out the Giraph source from the <a href="http://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/giraph.git">git repository</a>.</li>
      <li>Make a release branch <tt>git checkout -b release-1.2; git push origin release-1.2</tt></li>
      <li>Once you have a release branch, setup continuous integration in Jenkins. <a href="https://builds.apache.org/job/Giraph-1.2/">See for example a setup for Giraph 1.2 release</a></li>
      <li>Fix test cases and build errors until you have a clean build for both hadoop_1 and hadoop_2 profiles</li>
      <li>Check JIRA tickets associated with this release and make sure you don't have any open</li>
      <li>When you have everything ready for the release, create a tag <tt>git tag -a rel/1.2.0-RC1 -m "Preparing release 1.2.0"</tt></li>
      <li>Do the license check: <tt>mvn apache-rat:check -Phadoop_1</tt>  and make sure you don't have any issues <tt>grep '!?????' target/rat.txt</tt>
      </li>
      <li>When all of above are clean, you can do the build: <tt>mvn clean install -Phadoop_1 -Prelease</tt>
      If this command fails generating signatures <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html">check this page for more information</a></li>
      <li>You can now get the prepared binaries, source files and signatures in <tt>giraph-dist/target/</tt></li>
      <li>To generate remaining md5 and sha1 hashes, wou can use the following set of commands:
        <source>
md5 -r * |grep -v asc | while read k f; do
  echo $k > "$f.md5"
done

shasum * |grep -v asc |grep -v md5 | while read k f; do
  echo $k > "$f.sha1"
done
        </source>
      </li>
      <li>Now you need to build release for hadoop_2. First, change version in all pom.xml files:
          <source>
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.2.0-hadoop2
grep -R 'version.*1.2.0' . | grep pom.xml | grep -v hadoop2
          </source>
      Make sure the output of the second command is empty. Modify missed pom.xml manually otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat steps for hadoop_2 profile:
          <source>
mvn apache-rat:check -Phadoop_2
grep '!?????' target/rat.txt

mvn clean install -Phadoop_2

          </source>
          Get release files from <tt>~/.m2/repository/org/apache/giraph/giraph-dist/1.2.0-hadoop2</tt> and sign them.

      </li>
      <li>Finally make files available in dist SVN:
          <tt>svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/giraph/</tt>
          Make sure that the content there looks ok (try to build and run Giraph just from those tarballs).
      </li>
      <li>
      Configure your .m2/settings.xml as described <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#dev-env">here</a>. And deploy released artifacts to the maven repository:
          <source>
mvn -Prelease -Phadoop_1 deploy
mvn -Prelease -Phadoop_2 deploy
          </source>
      </li>

    </ul>
