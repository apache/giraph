    <title>How to build this site in maven</title>
  </properties>

  <body>
    <section name="Summary">
      <p>We build this site with Maven using the fluido plugin.  Due to difficulties with the maven site plugin and munge working together, we build the site using a profile that does not require munge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start at the parent directory and do <source>mvn -Phadoop_2 clean site -DskipTests</source></li>
        <li>Then we need to stage this site since it has multiple modules with <source>mvn -Phadoop_2 site:stage -DskipTests</source></li>
        <li>You can check the results of the site building and staging in <source>target/staging</source> and then deploy as necessary.</li>
        <li>To deploy, check out the site from svn with <source>svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/giraph/site</source>.  Remove everything and then copy the staged site to the directory and then commit.  All changes should be live immediately.</li>
      </ul>
